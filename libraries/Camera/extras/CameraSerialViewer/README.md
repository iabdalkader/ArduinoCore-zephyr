# Camera Serial Viewer

Live preview for the camera, over the board's USB serial port.

Use it with the `CameraSerialStream` example sketch. The sketch sends each frame behind a
small header describing the frame, so the viewer picks up the resolution and pixel format
from the wire - change the mode in the sketch and nothing here needs editing.

## Usage

1. Open `examples/CameraSerialStream/CameraSerialStream.ino` and upload it to the board.

2. Close the Serial Monitor, or anything else holding the port open.

3. Install the dependencies and run the viewer:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ./CameraSerialViewer.py
   ```

Press `q` or `Escape` to quit.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-p`, `--port` | Serial port. Autodetected when omitted |
| `-c`, `--credits` | Frame requests kept outstanding (default 2) |
| `-s`, `--scale` | Display scale factor (default 2.0) |
| `-b`, `--bench` | Measure the link only: read frames but do not decode or display them |

The window title shows the frame rate, throughput, resolution, and counts of dropped
frames and resynchronisations, updated once a second. The console gets the same line plus
the per-frame split between reading and rendering, which is useful for telling a slow link
apart from a slow host.

### Dependencies

`pyserial` and `Pillow`, plus `tkinter` for the window. tkinter is part of the standard
library but is packaged separately on some systems:

- Debian / Ubuntu: `apt install python3-tk`
- macOS with Homebrew: `brew install python-tk`
- pyenv: install `tcl-tk` first, then rebuild the interpreter

## Replaces the Processing viewer

This replaces the `CameraCaptureRawBytes` example and its `CameraRawBytesVisualizer`
Processing sketch, both of which have been removed. That pair needed the Processing IDE,
hardcoded the resolution and pixel format in a second place that had to be kept in sync
with the sketch by hand, and had no framing - so a single stray byte on the wire
desynchronised it permanently. Here the geometry comes from the frame header, and you can
add `Serial.print()` calls to the sketch while debugging: the viewer skips over them and
carries on.

## Protocol

Every frame is preceded by a 20 byte header. All multi-byte fields are little-endian.

| Offset | Size | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `sync` | Bytes `D5 AA 96 5A`, in that wire order |
| 4 | 1 | `version` | Protocol version, currently `1` |
| 5 | 1 | `format` | `0` = RGB565, `1` = GRAYSCALE8 (matches `CameraPixelFormat`) |
| 6 | 1 | `flags` | bit 0: payload is little-endian RGB565 (`byte_swap` was enabled). Other bits reserved, sent as 0 |
| 7 | 1 | reserved | Sent as 0 |
| 8 | 2 | `width` | Pixels |
| 10 | 2 | `height` | Pixels |
| 12 | 4 | `length` | Payload bytes following the header |
| 16 | 4 | `seq` | Frame counter, wraps at 2^32. Lets the host count dropped frames |

There is one command, host to board:

| Byte | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `R` | request | Send exactly one frame |

### Notes on the design

**Flow control is credit-based.** The host sends `R` twice at startup and one more each
time it finishes reading a frame. Two outstanding requests keep the link busy, since the
board captures the next frame while the host is still reading the previous one. They also
bound how far ahead the board runs: `Serial.write()` blocks until the host drains it, so
without a credit limit a host that went away would leave the board stuck mid-frame with
more already queued behind it.

**Resynchronisation.** The host scans for `sync`, then sanity-checks the header
(`version`, a known `format`, and `length` matching `width * height * bytes_per_pixel`)
before trusting it. The sync word is deliberately non-ASCII, so text printed by the sketch
can never contain it, and non-self-overlapping, so a failed match can advance a byte
without backtracking.

**No checksum.** USB already checksums and retransmits at the link layer, so silent
corruption is not the realistic failure; losing framing is, and `sync`, `length` and `seq`
cover that. The `version` field is there if this ever needs revisiting.
